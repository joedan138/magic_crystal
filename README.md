#### Description

Magic Crystal is a simple brain teaser in which you must click the 4 magic crystals to guess the correct number. The values of each crystal are not shown so you must use some simple math to guess the number.

#### Challenges
This was my second game I created in my bootcamp. Again I wanted to focus on the design so it felt a little more sophistaceted than it actually was. Out of all the games I built in the course I probably had the most fun building this one. The design proved to be the harder part again because I could not get the red curtain background to lay right. After a lot of toil I was finally able to get it straightened out. 

The hardest part in the logic was getting the score to +1 for each win/loss AND THEN refresh the target number

#### Issues
Currently there are 2 issues with the gameplay. 

1. The red curtain background does not fully load when the instructions appear. 

2. The game is mostly mobile responsive. The red curtain backgroun does not resize correctly when the browser window is smaller.

#### Desired Features

* I would like for modals to appear when you have either won or lost. Currently there is no notification for winning, and an alert for when you lose. 

* I also want the instructions listed in a modal as opposed to an alert

* I want the crystals to change values after each game. At a minimim I want to create a button that randmoly regenerates the crystal value
